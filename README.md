 Here 2 questions are solved..

First program is to print a * pattern   


I have used two for loops to iterate.

I divided the pattern into two parts and in the first part i have printed from 0 to input -1 number of stars in a seperate line by using \r

And in the second part I have printed from input-1 till 0.


Second program is to get a input from a user and we need to reverse the word

I have used indexing and slicing to get the result  i.e(s[::-1])
